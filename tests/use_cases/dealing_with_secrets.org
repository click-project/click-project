There are plenty of use cases that need to use some secret value.

Let's dig into how those are done in clk.

Because clk uses click, the most obvious way of using a secret value is to use
[[https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/options/#password-prompts][the click way]], with ~hide_input=True, confirmation_prompt=True, prompt=True~:
This will ask twice for the password, hiding the input.

For the sake of the example, let's imagine you create a tool that calls some
http endpoint that requires a bearer token.

Something that would be called like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results none :exports code
  clk http --base-url http://somesite --bearer sometoken get /something
#+END_SRC

This translates into something that looks like the following python code.

#+NAME: command
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results none :exports code
  class HTTPConfig:
      pass

  @group()
  @option("--bearer", help="The bearer token to request the API", prompt=True, confirmation_prompt=True, hide_input=True, expose_class=HTTPConfig)
  @option("--base-url", help="The url of the site to play with", expose_class=HTTPConfig)
  def http():
      "Commands to play with some OAuth 2 protected site"

  @http.command()
  @argument("path", help="The endpoint to call")
  def get(path):
      "Perform a get request from the site"
      print(f"Calling {config.http.base_url}/{path} with bearer token {config.http.bearer}")

#+END_SRC

#+NAME: createthecommand
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results none :exports none :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :noweb yes
  clk command create python --group http
  cat<<EOF >> "${CLKCONFIGDIR}/python/http.py"
  <<command>>
  EOF

#+END_SRC

If you simply use that command, it will prompt you for the password. This may be
not very practical if you are used to call this command pretty often.

To get more information about the pattern behind ~expose_class=HTTPConfig~, see
the tutorial about [[file:dynamic_parameters_and_exposed_class.org][dynamic parameters]].

You may be tempted to add the secret in a simple parameter, like this.

#+NAME: setsecretinparameter
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports both :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :cache yes

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS[158a00a9080e5ab95503802e0a00fdd22a999100]: usesecretinparameter
: Calling someurl/someendpoint with bearer token mytoken

This works, but it keeps the bearer token in plain text into the clk
parameters. That is not ideal security-wise.

What we can do instead is use a special value for this parameter that tells clk
to lookup the value in your password manager instead.

#+NAME: usethebearefromsecret
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports both :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :cache yes

: Removing global parameters of http: --bearer mytoken
: New global parameters for http: --bearer secret:http_bearer

Here is some explanation:
1. the ~noeval:~ prefix tells clk not to replace the following content, so that the secret is not actually looked up when you create the parameter. That way, the parameter will be the literal ~secret:http_bearer~ instead of its content,
2. ~secret:http_bearer~ tells clk to get the secret from your secret manager at the key ~http_bearer~


If the secret is not there, clk will fail and tell you that it could not find it.

#+NAME: httpwithsecretfail
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports both :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :cache yes

#+RESULTS[158a00a9080e5ab95503802e0a00fdd22a999100]: httpwithsecretfail
: error: Could not find the secret for http_bearer

Now, there are two situations: either you have access to a password manager, or
you don't.

  If ~clk~ needs to get access to a secret but you don't have a password
  manager, it will fail[fn:1]. But you can tell ~clk~ to ask you for the
  password by providing the ~--ask-secret~ flag.

  :END:

  If you have access to a password manager and want to use it, here is how you
  would proceed.

  Every password manager has its particularities, therefore ~clk~ does not try
  to guess where the secret is located. It uses [[https://github.com/jaraco/keyring][keyring]] to deal with secrets and
  provides a few commands to lookup and store secrets using keyring.

  #+NAME: providepassword
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results none :exports none :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f
    clk secret set --set-parameter global --secret mytoken
  #+END_SRC

  To store a secret, use this command:

  #+NAME: storeasecret
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results none :exports code :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f
    clk secret set http_bearer
  #+END_SRC

  As you can see, you don't directly write the secret in the command line, for the
  same reasons explained above.

  Let's assume for the sake of this use case that you typed "mytoken" when
  prompted for a value.

  Then, you can look up a secret with:

  #+NAME: showsecret
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports both :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :cache yes
    clk secret show http_bearer
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS[442139aba4b7a95e06870afa13c4062b5dec3796]: showsecret
  : http_bearer *****

  The secret is not actually shown, to avoid secrets to easily show up when you
  don't want them to. What this command tells is that a secret actually exists
  associated to that key. The only information that you have is that there
  indeed exists a secret with that name.

  To have ~clk~ show the secret, you need to add the ~--secret~ flag.

  #+NAME: reallyshowsecret
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports both :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :cache yes
    clk secret show http_bearer --secret
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS[929e49b3d0d6a80136cd215c9aadabdf4df6ad03]: reallyshowsecret
  : http_bearer mytoken

  It might look cumbersome to simply see this piece of information, but this is
  actually the point: avoiding leaking your password.

  In case you want to provide this secret to another command and just want the
  secret, nothing more.

  #+NAME: reallyshowonlysecret
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports both :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :cache yes

  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS[8e3cb798399ccc8ddaed0841489aaaa0f6833598]: reallyshowonlysecret
  : mytoken

  Now, putting things together, the previous command will work as expected.

  #+NAME: httpwithsecret
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim :exports both :session 0b6acd63-d091-4c6b-83f6-7d2dd3ce908f :cache yes

  The secret feature of ~clk~ is only a small wrapper on top of [[https://github.com/jaraco/keyring][keyring]]. If you
  configured keyring to use a backend, it will be used in clk.

  If you want to overwrite this in ~clk~, you can pass the import value in the
  ~--keyring~ option.

  For example, clk comes with a keyring to read secrets from netrc, implemented by
  the class ~NetrcKeyring~ of the module ~clk.keyrings~.

  Let's try to use netrc to provide the secret. The built-in netrc keyring
  assume that the secret name is put in the field ~machine~ of the netrc file
  and that the secret is in the field password.
