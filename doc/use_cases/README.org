Here are some use cases that hopefully will have the following properties:
- provide a better idea of what clk is capable of than a simple description,
- show some common pattern that emerged when using clk,
- give examples of real life uses of clk, giving hints about when it might be useful,

If you simply want to create bash commands, take a look at [[file:bash_command.org][this one]]. This [[file:bash_command_use_option.org][other
one]] provides more insights about how to define options. When those will get
bigger, take a look at how to [[file:bash_command_import.org][split your code]]. In particular, you might want to
start small with [[file:bash_command_from_alias.md][simple alias and then move to bash commands]]. Also, clk provides
some useful "[[file:bash_command_built_in_lib.org][batteries]]" to help you create a nice and friendly command.

Sometimes, you might want to have some control about how the arguments of the
command lines are evaluated, take a look at [[file:controlling_a_server_using_an_environment_variable.org][this use case]] to know more about them.

Also, to create powerful, dynamic command line tools that provide the best
completion possible, see [[file:dynamic_parameters_and_exposed_class.org][this pattern]] for writing your commands. In case you
have some issues, you might want to look at the [[file:dynamic_parameters_advanced_use_cases.org][advanced use cases]].

To cache some computation to disk, see the [[file:scrapping_the_web.org][web scrapping]] use case.

If at some point you need to deal with a project, you might want to [[file:using_a_project.org][read this]].

But, eventually, you might want to use python commands to have a full control
over the user experience.  Then, you might want a quick look at the [[file:lib.org][available
helpers]].

At some point, you will definitely want to try the use case about [[file:3D_printing_flow.org][a 3D printing flow]].

If you don't want to use the clk command line tool, you can [[file:rolling_your_own.org][roll your own]].

Some commands might need to use secret, [[file:dealing_with_secrets.org][here is how]] we implement that.

This example of an [[file:ethereum_local_environment_dev_tool.org][ethereum local environment dev tool]] shows how to plug clk
commands as parameters in other commands. [[file:ipfs_name_publish.org][ipfs name publish]] shows how to use clk
bash commands to create the completion for other commands.
