This is the main entry point of the documentation.

For now, only the [[./use_cases][use cases]] are worth reading. They show several real life
situations that highlight how *clk* may be used.

I started to write some code literate programming, so you can find the generated
documentation in [[./lp][here]], but it is still quite useless on its current state.
