This is the main entry point of the documentation.

For now, only the [use cases](./use_cases) are worth reading. They show several real life situations that highlight how **clk** may be used.

I started to write some code literate programming, so you can find the generated documentation in [here](./lp), but it is still quite useless on its current state.
